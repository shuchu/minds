Flow collector was written by Eric Eilertson, eric@cs.umn.edu, please send
questions or comments there.

Flow collector can be used to listen to a network interface, or read a
tcpdump file and create records similar to netflows.  Netflows can't be
duplicate exactly from only tcpdump since AS number information as such
is not available, but this will give insight into traffic patterns.

The heuristics for building sessions are just that, they do not follow
the network definition for a session, and I build sessions where they do
not exist by definition, i.e. udp.  I do this to try and capture the
intent of the packets, and grouping related packets together.  

The usage is simple, collector collector.config.  The config file has 
just a few paramaters 

interface is used to state which network interface should be listened 
too.  This will usually require root permissions.

tcpdumpfile is used to indicate which tcpdumpfile should be read.

outfile is the prefix of the output file.  This is appended with the 
time window for that run. 

file_close_time is used to indicate how often one flow file should be 
closed and another started.  It should be noted, that just because the 
time for a file to be closed has passed does not mean the file will be 
closed.  This only happens once a flow has been closed during the time 
window.

num_packets_cleanup defines how often memory management is to be 
performed.  This is actually used for each packet type, i.e. tcp, udp, 
ipsec.  So a value of 100000 might be best for tcp, but this will let 
ipsec sessions linger in memory for quite a while before being written.
