This is the tcpdump version of MINDS.  This reads in a tcpdump file, and
begins processing once the entire file is read in.  The basic usage is

minds minds.config minds.rules output_file_name input_tcpdump_file
training_prefix num_threads

minds.config is the configuraiton file, which specifies the parameters to be
used in the run

minds.rules is the rules file specifying anything to be ignored, and how to
partition the data (if desired).  The minds.rules file included breaks the
data into tcp, udp, icmp, ipsec and other.

output_file_name is the prefix that will be used for the output filenames.

input_tcpdump_file is the tcpdump file that will be used for this run

num_threads This is the number of threads to be used for the anomaly
detection core.  If you have a single processor computer just set this to 1,
if you have a multi processor computer (or a pentium 4/xeon with
hyper threading) set this to the number of cpus or cores.

Documentation on the config and rules files can be found in the other README
files in this directory.
